LOGS FILE - 

04/16/2021 - Thought of this super late in the semester to track my work on this project and express
thoughts/feelings about the project as time goes on. I have under a month to finish this, a 12 page
research paper, and somehow fit studying for my diff. eq. and linear algebra classes in as well. I'm
pretty confident that I'll pull it off while slowly losing sanity and falling into a coma from caffeine
use, but the grades will be well-worth the effort if I get all A's. 
Now onto the project, I still don't have the data from the dean, which is frustrating to say the
least, given that it's the whole crux of my project. We need to turn in the MySQL scripts that create
the database and since I have no data, no database can be created. However, I do possess a test database
that can be used in the case that the WCC dean doesn't come through with the goods. It's not very
comprehensive, and would make the project more of a proof of concept than anything which sucks, but
if it's the best that I can do with what I have, then I hope professor Daly understands. If I 
don't get the data within the week, I'll email professor Daly requesting that my database contents
be admitted as is until the data comes from the dean, and I'll ask the dean myself, which I probably
should have done a while ago. Problem is, I don't know which dean to contanct. I know Mr. Little,
and have some history with him, so maybe if I explain that this is for a class and would be willing
to work with WaWa's TAC to make it into a viable tool for the MyWCC portal, maybe he'd be inclined
to help me out. Ultimately, if the data is never recieved, I'm going to have to have a recourse.
An idea that just dawned on me is to still have separate arrays for the different classes and whatnot
but to have the user enter them if all goes to hell and I have no data. I'll just have to modify my 
database by a little bit and batta bing batta boom we got ourselves a recourse. I'll start developing 
that on the side to ensure that I have a functional project to present. This will be the end of my log
for the night.
